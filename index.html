                        Hi, I'm Robert Anderson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a web developer with a lifelong passion for technology and learning. From the time I was
                        allowed on my familyâ€™s computer, I have pursued my love of computers through graphic design,
                        writing grants as a teen for my own equipment and classes, and starting a business building
                        computers. In college I studied graphic design as well as computer science. Since then, I have
                        worked at a tech support help-desk, and was personally sought out by the development team, for
                        my attention to detail when testing, to become the founding member of the QA team working with
                        automated and manual testing. My work on a team of passionate developers has allowed me to
                        thrive in an environment of innovation, community, and learning. I love working with front-end
                        web technology and continue to advance my skills in pursuit of working as a front-end web
                        developer.
