                          <p>I am a web developer with a lifelong passion for technology and learning. </p>
                          <p>From the time I was allowed on my familyâ€™s computer, I have pursued my love of computers through graphic design, writing grants as a teen for my own equipment and classes, and starting a business building computers. In college I studied graphic design as well as computer science. Since then, I have worked at a tech support help-desk, and was personally sought out by the development team, for my attention to detail when testing, to become the founding member of the QA team working with automated and manual testing. My work on a team of passionate developers has allowed me to thrive in an environment of innovation, community, and learning. I love working with front-end web technology and continue to advance my skills in pursuit of working as a front-end web developer.</p>
